                                    <p>Little short strokes. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You can create anything that makes you happy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Take your time. Speed will come later. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>
                            
                                    
                                    <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. Let your imagination be your guide. In your world you can create anything you desire. At home you have unlimited time..</p>
                                    <p>We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Brown is such a nice color. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.</p>
